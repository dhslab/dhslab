<p><strong>David Spencer is a board-certified Molecular Pathologist</strong> and Medical Director of the
<a href="https://genome.wustl.edu">McDonnell Genome Institute</a>’s CLIA Licensed Environment (MGI-CLE), a CLIA-licensed, CAP-accredited clinical
sequencing laboratory. He and his colleagues in the MGI-CLE
and the <a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/">Department of Pathology and Immunology</a>
have developed and implemented multiple advanced clinical
sequencing assays for both translational research and patient care.</p>

<p><strong>In his role as Medical Director, David oversees the design,
development, and implementation of all NGS assays in the MGI Clinical
sequencing lab, including wet lab and bioinformatics.</strong> He
reviews all documentation and quality control data to maintain
compliance with CLIA regulations and CAP checklist requirements, and
serves as a consultant to investigators and clinicians who want to
incorporate NGS testing into their research and/or clinical practice.</p>

<p><img src="/images/respic/chromoseq.png" alt="chromoseq" width="125px" class="img-responsive" style="float: left; padding-right: 10px" /> <strong>ChromoSeq:</strong> Streamlined
   whole-genome sequencing for cancers. Dr. Spencer and his colleagues Dr. Molly Schroeder and
   Dr. Eric Duncavage developed this assay to provide comprehensive
   genomic profiling of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
   myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and published it in the <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2024534">New England
   Journal of
   Medicine</a> in
   March 2021. This publication was the first to demonstrate that
   genome sequencing can be used in a clinical setting for fast,
   accurate, and accessible genetic testing of tumors. It is currently
   being performed on all new AML patients at <a href="https://www.barnesjewish.org/">Barnes-Jewish Hospital</a>.</p>

<p><strong>MyeloSeq:</strong> Error-corrected targeted sequencing for diagnosis and molecular monitoring of patients with myeloid malignancies. This assay
  uses Agilent’s HaloplexHS unique molecular identifier (UMI)-based amplicon system to sequence 48 genes that are recurrently mutated in
  AML, MDS, and MPN. High coverage sequencing, error-correction, and
  custom analysis is performed using approaches developed by Eric
  Duncavage, Haley Abel, and David Spencer and is coded in WDL and
  executed via Cromwell.</p>

<p><img src="/images/respic/amlclearance.png" alt="amlclearance" height="100px" class="img-responsive" style="float: right" /> <strong>AML Clearance Exome Sequencing:</strong> This assay uses deep exome
  sequencing to identify dozens of mutations in the leukemia cells of
  AML patients at diagnosis, and then test whether these
  patient-specific mutations are present in exome sequencing data from
  the patient’s bone marrow cells
  after they receive therapy. <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2429715">Previous studies</a> have shown that the
  presence of persistent mutations is associated with worse outcomes,
  even when patients have no detectable leukemia cells in their bone
  marrow. This assay is the core technology underlying a prospective
  clinical trial to determine whether molecular monitoring using this
  approach can improve outcomes for AML patients <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02756962">(NCT02756962)</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Tumor/Normal Exome Sequencing:</strong> Paired exome
  sequencing of tumor DNA and normal DNA from the same patient to
  identify somatic mutations. Analysis uses a custom ensemble pipeline
  encoded in CWL and executed with the Cromwell engine. This assay can be performed on any
  tumor type or specimen and is used to identify somatic mutations for
  translational studies using somatic mutations to manufacture
  patient-specific tumor vaccines.</p>

<p><strong>Exome Sequencing (technical sequencing only):</strong> This assay uses
  hybrid-capture with a custom version of the IDT xGen Exome
  probeset for exome sequencing. This is a technical sequencing assay,
  and so analysis is performed for QC only. Variant analysis and all
  clinical interpretation is performed in the <a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/divisions/lgm/">Laboratory and Genomic
  Medicine</a> Division in the
<a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/">Department of Pathology and Immunology</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Comprehensive Cancer Gene Panel (technical sequencing only):</strong>
  High-coverage targeted sequencing of cancer-related genes. This
  assay also uses hybrid-capture with a custom IDT xGen probeset and is a technical
  sequencing only assay. Variant analysis and all
  clinical interpretation is performed in the <a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/divisions/lgm/">Laboratory and Genomic Medicine</a> Division in the
  <a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/">Department of Pathology and Immunology</a>.</p>

<p>Clinical sequencing assays in the MGI-CLE are available for patient care through either the
<a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/research/core-facilities/anatomic-molecular-pathology-core-lab/">AMP Core Labs</a>in
the
<a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/divisions/amp/">Anatomic and Molecular Pathology</a>
Divsion or the
<a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/divisions/lgm/">Laboratory and Genomic Medicine</a>
Division in the
<a href="https://pathology.wustl.edu/">Department of Pathology and Immunology</a>.</p>

<p>David is Technical Director of the AMP Core Labs and works with faculty and
staff in the AMP division to manage the ‘NGS
distributed testing’ workflow for cancer testing testing performed in
the MGI-CLE lab.</p>
