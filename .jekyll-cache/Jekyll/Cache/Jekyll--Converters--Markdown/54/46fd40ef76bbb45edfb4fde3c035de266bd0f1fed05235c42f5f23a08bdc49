  computational science that is focused on the common theme of the
  genetics, genomics, and epigenetics of acute
  myeloid leukemia.</strong> We have specific expertise in DNA methylation, 3D genome architecture, and
  HOX gene expression and regulation in AML, although we are broadly interested in
  epigenetics and gene regulation in cancer. We also have extensive
  experience using genomic technologies to make observations in
  primary human samples to understand fundamental mechanisms of
  cancer genomics.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><strong>We use a range of experimental systems and techniques in our lab, including:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, error-corrected
amplicon sequencing</li>
  <li>Long read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio Hifi platforms</li>
  <li>ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&amp;Run, CUT&amp;Tag</li>
  <li>in situ HiC, capture-C, HiChIP, PLAC-seq</li>
  <li>Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing</li>
  <li>CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, CRISPRi epigenetic editing</li>
  <li>CRE-seq massively parallel reporter assays</li>
  <li>Single cell technologies</li>
  <li>Human cell lines, human pluripotent stem cells, including NIH-approved embryonic
  stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.</li>
  <li>Primary human AML samples</li>
  <li>Mouse models

</ul>

<p><strong>We have direct access to high-throughput sequencers and cutting edge
genomic methods</strong> at the McDonnell Genome Institute via Davidâ€™s role as
Medical Director of the CLIA sequencing lab. We perform our own data analysis on a dedicated compute cluster using
analysis pipelines that we developed and implemented for our
research.</p>
