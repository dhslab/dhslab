## Teaching

**Teaching and mentorship are important priorities in the Spencer
lab.** David is in the lab every day (mostly) and his door is always
open to discuss experiments, results, data analysis, and science in
general. Science careers are very challenging, and he is also eager to
help trainees of all types choose and navigate their career path,
whatever it might be.

been involved with are listed below.
