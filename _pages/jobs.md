## Open positions

### We have currently openings for post-docs who are interested in human genomics, epigenetics and cancer biology.

The Spencer lab combines wet and dry lab experiments to study the fundamental biology of genomes and pursue clinical/translational genomic studies. Ideal candidates will have some informatics skills but not be afraid to wield a pipettor! Email David Spencer at dspencerlab [at] gmail.com or apply at [Wash U Jobs](https://jobs.wustl.edu/)

## Graduate students

We are always looking for talented and motivated graduate students! The Spencer Lab is an ideal training environment for students interested in genomics and human disease. We use cutting-edge approaches for 'functional genomics' to study primary human samples from patients and understand basic mechanisms in human cell lines, pluripotent stem cells, and mouse models. Students can choose whether their thesis is experimental, computational, or both. There are also many opportunities for translational studies through collaborations with the Division of Oncology and the McDonnell Genome Institute, where Dr. Spencer is the Medical Director. If you are a Wash U DBBS student and interested in a rotation in the Spencer lab, email dspencerlab [at] gmail.com.
