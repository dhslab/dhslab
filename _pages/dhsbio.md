  David is from Iowa City, Iowa. He attended Iowa City City High
  School where he played soccer and was introduced to genetic
  research through a program that placed high school students in
  research labs at the University of Iowa. He first worked for
  geneticist Brian Schutte, PhD, and later spent two summers in the lab of Jeff Murray,
  MD, where he was introduced to DNA sequencing and the human genome
  project. After high school David left Iowa for Seattle, Washington
  to attend college at the University of Washington. He earned a
  B.S. in Biochemistry and worked for four years in the UW Genome
  Center.

an Assistant Professor of Medicine in the Division of
Oncology, an Assistant Professor of Pathology and Immunology, and
Medical Director of the CLIA-Licensed Environment at the McDonnell
Genome Institute at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri,
USA. He earned his MD and PhD in the combined Medical Scientist Training Program at the University of Washington in Seattle. His graduate studies took place in the Department of Genome Sciences with human genome pioneers Bob Waterston and Maynard Olson. His thesis work was on the development and application of methods to sequence and analyze large regions of the human genome and included one of the first uses of hybridization-capture to identify disease-causing mutations in the human genome. David completed his residency training in Clinical Pathology and a fellowship in Molecular Genetic Pathology at Washington University/Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri, during which he was involved in developing one of the first targeted gene panels for detecting cancer mutations. Following his clinical training, Dr. Spencer did post-doctoral research in the laboratory of renowned cancer biologist Tim Ley, where he studied the genomics and epigenomics of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). He led studies that defined the effects of decitabine treatment on DNA methylation in primary AML samples, identified functional differences between AML subclones, investigated the mechanism involved in HOX gene regulation in normal hematopoiesis and AML, and characterized the landscape of DNA methylation changes that occur in primary AML samples with mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A. 

David's research program is focused on improving the genetic diagnosis of AML and our understanding of its molecular pathogenesis at the level of the genome. His lab studies the regulation of the HOX gene family and how the chromatin regulator CTCF organizes the three-dimensional structure of the HOX locus and influences functional interactions with regulatory enhancers in normal hematopoietic cells and in AML. He also studies patterns of DNA methylation in AML and how these changes relate to recurrent mutations, and the mechanisms by which altered DNA methylation influences genome architecture and gene regulation. Dr. Spencer directs the CLIA-Licensed Environment clinical sequencing laboratory, which supports clinical trials involving sequencing of tumor samples, including AML. The laboratory also performs sequencing of patient samples for clinical tests available at Washington University, including clinical gene panel assays for solid tumors and myeloid malignancies, whole exome sequencing of tumors for tumor vaccine studies, and targeted sequencing for inherited diseases. Dr. Spencer is also a co-developer of ChromoSeq, a clinical whole genome sequencing assay for genomic profiling of AML and MDS, which is currently in use for routine diagnostic testing of all AML patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. Dr. Spencer’s work has been supported by grants from the National Cancer Institute, the American Society of Hematology, the American Cancer Society, The Cancer Research Foundation, and The Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.

**Teaching and mentorship are important priorities in the Spencer
lab.** David is in the lab every day (mostly) and his door is always
open to discuss experiments, results, data analysis, and science in
general. Science careers are very challenging, and he is also eager to
help trainees of all types choose and navigate their career path,
whatever it might be.
