## Welcome to The Spencer Lab at Wash U ##

#### The Spencer Lab is in the Section of Stem Cell Biology in the [Division of Oncology](https://oncology.wustl.edu/) in the
[Department of Medine](https://internalmedicine.wustl.edu/) at [Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu/). ####

  id="" style="float:right; border-radius:0%; padding-left:20px"} **Research in the Spencer lab is a combination of experimental and
  computational science with the genomics and epigenetics of acute
  myeloid leukemia the common theme.** We
  have specific expertise in DNA methylation, 3D genome architecture, and
  HOX gene expression and regulation in AML, although we are broadly interested in
  epigenetics and gene regulation in cancer. We also have extensive
  experience using genomic technologies to make observations in
  primary human samples to understand fundamental mechanisms of
  cancer genomics.

<br/>

**We use a range of experimental systems and techniques in our lab, including:**
  * Whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, error-corrected
    amplicon sequencing
  * Long read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio Hifi platforms
  * ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, CUT&Run, CUT&Tag ![HOXA locus](/images/respic/hoxamodel.png){:width="400px"
  id="" style="float:right; border-radius:0%; padding-left:20px"} 
  * in situ HiC, capture-C, HiChIP, PLAC-seq
  * Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
  * CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, CRISPRi epigenetic editing
  * CRE-seq massively parallel reporter assays
  * Single cell technologies
  * Human cell lines, human pluripotent stem cells, including NIH-approved embryonic
  stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.
  * Primary human AML samples
  * Mouse models

**We have direct access to high-throughput sequencers and cutting edge
genomic methods** at the McDonnell Genome Institute via David's role as
Medical Director of the CLIA sequencing lab. We perform our own data analysis on a dedicate compute cluster using
analysis pipelines that we developed and implemented for our
research.
