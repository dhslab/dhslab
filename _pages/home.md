We are a basic science and translational research group at [Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine](https://medicine.wustl.edu/). Our aim is to understand the human genome and how genetic mutations and epigenetic changes affect its function in disease, particularly cancer.

To this end, we develop novel spectroscopic-imaging scanning tunneling microscopy (SI-STM) tools to visualize the relevant quantum mechanical degrees of freedom. We want to be able to build the perfect instruments to answer the  scientific questions we deem most important (see [Research](research)).

We are located at Leiden University, the birthplace of superconductivity and home to Kamerlingh Onnes, Lorentz, Huygens, Einstein, de Sitter, and others (see e.g. [the wall of signatures from Ehrenfest lecturers](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/history/colloquium/muur_heel.html)). We exchange ideas and work with our neighbors from [Quantum Matter & Optics](http://www.physics.leidenuniv.nl/qo-home), as well as with the colleagues from our [world-class theory section](https://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl).

 **We are  looking for PhD students and Postdocs to join the team** [(more info)]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/vacancies) **!**
