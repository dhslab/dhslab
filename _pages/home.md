## Welcome to The Spencer Lab at Wash U ##

The Spencer Lab is in the Section of Stem Cell Biology in the [Division
of Oncology](https://oncology.wustl.edu/) in the
[Department of Medine](https://internalmedicine.wustl.edu/) at
[Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis](https://medicine.wustl.edu/).

  id="" style="float:left; border-radius:0%;background-color:white; padding-right:20px"} **Research in the Spencer lab is a combination of experimental and
  computational science with cancer genomics as the common theme.** We
  have specific expertise in DNA methylation, 3D genome architecture, and
  HOX gene expression and regulation, although we are broadly interested in
  epigenetics and gene regulation in cancer.

<br/>

To study these topics we use a range of experimental systems and techniques, including:
  * Whole-exome sequencing, whole-genome sequencing, error-corrected
    amplicon sequencing
  * Long read sequencing using Oxford Nanopore and PacBio Hifi platforms
  * ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, ATAC-seq
  * whole-genome bisulfite sequencing
  * CUT&Run, CUT&Tag
  * in situ HiC, capture-C, HiChIP, PLAC-seq
  * CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing, CRISPRi epigenetic editing
  * CRE-seq massively parallel reporter assays
  * Single cell technologies
  * Human cell lines
  * Human pluripotent stem cells, including NIH-approved embryonic
  stem cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells.
  * Primary human AML samples
  * Mouse models

We have direct access to high-throughput sequencers and cutting edge
genomic methods at the McDonnell Genome Institute via David's role as
Medical Director of the CLIA sequencing lab. We perform our own data analysis on a dedicate compute cluster using
analysis pipelines that we developed and implemented for our
research.
