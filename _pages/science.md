## Science

#### The Spencer lab studies the organization and function of the human genome and how altered genome function contributes to cancer.

**Our group specializes in cancer genetics, genomics, and
epigenetics.** We are specifically focused on acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), a devastating cancer that affects children and adults. Despite major
advances in the molecular understanding of this disease, current
therapies have changed little over the past 30
years. ![AML blasts](/images/aml.png){:width="150px"

understand how mutations and epigenetic changes alter the structure
and function of the genome in ways that contribute to AML development, progression,
and relapse.

#### Current Research projects ####

1. **HOX gene regulation in AML.** HOX genes regulate normal
self-renewal in hematopoietic cells and are highly expressed in AML cells, suggesting they drive malignant
self-renewal in AML. ![AML blasts](/images/aml.png){:width="150px"

Transcriptomic profiling of nearly 200 primary AML samples
by our group showed that HOXA and/or HOXB genes are highly expressed
in more than half of all AML patients and are therefore among the most
common drivers of self-renewal in AML cells [(Spencer et al., Leukemia
2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/leu20156). These and other studies have also demonstrated that HOX gene
expression occurs in canonical, reproducible patterns in primary AML
samples that are closely associated with specific
mutations. While progress has been made in understanding—and
targeting—HOX gene regulation in some rare AML types, effective
therapeutic strategies for most patients have not been
identified. Research in other experimental systems has shown that
three-dimensional (3D) genome
interactions are important for regulating the HOXA gene cluster. We
have investigated the 3D genome architecture of the HOXA cluster in
AML cells with mutations in NPM1. These studies identified We will use genomic methods and functional analysis to define the specific 3D genome interactions, regulatory DNA elements, and epigenetic pathways that are responsible for HOXA gene activation in AMLs with common recurrent mutations. These findings may therefore suggest therapeutic targets that could be immediately useful for disrupting aberrant self-renewal in AML patients.
