## Science

#### The Spencer lab studies the organization and function of the human genome and how altered genome function contributes to cancer.

**Our group specializes in cancer genetics, genomics, and
epigenetics.** We are specifically focused on acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), a devastating cancer that affects children and adults. Despite major
advances in the molecular understanding of this disease, current
therapies have changed little over the past 30
years. ![AML blasts](/images/aml.png){:width="150px"

understand how mutations and epigenetic changes alter the structure
and function of the genome in ways that contribute to AML development, progression,
and relapse.

#### Research projects ####

1. **HOX gene regulation in AML.** HOX genes regulate normal
self-renewal in hematopoietic cells and are highly expressed in more
than half of all AML patients, suggesting they drive malignant
self-renewal in AML. HOX genes
have 39 members arranged in four clusters on chromosomes 7 (HOXA), 17
(HOXB), 12 (HOXC) and 2 (HOXD) in humans. HOXC and HOXD genes are not
normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, but genes in the HOXA and
HOXB clusters are highly expressed in HSPCs, suggesting they
function to establish and/or maintain a stem cell state. This is
supported by functional studies in mice, which have demonstrated that
HoxA and HoxB proteins are required for maintaining hematopoietic
self-renewal and cause aberrant self-renewal, myeloproliferation, and
leukemia when expressed with other cooperating
genes. Transcriptomic profiling of nearly 200 primary AML samples
by our group showed that HOXA and/or HOXB genes are highly expressed
in more than half of all AML patients and are therefore among the most
common drivers of self-renewal in AML cells (Spencer et al., Leukemia
2015). These and other studies have also demonstrated that HOX gene
expression occurs in canonical, reproducible patterns in primary AML
samples that are closely associated with specific
mutations. The most tightly linked associations are expression
of the HOXA gene cluster with KMT2A rearrangements, and expression of
both HOXA and HOXB genes in AML cells with recurrent insertion
mutations in the NPM1 gene. Although inhibitors for specific factors
involved in HOXA gene regulation have been identified for some AML
types18,19, the importance of HOX genes for normal function in HSCs
has limited their clinical efficacy20. Identification of pathways that
regulate HOX genes in AML could therefore provide new targets for
disrupting aberrant self-renewal while limiting toxicity.

HOX genes Three dimensional genome
   interactions are known to be important for regulating the HOXA gene cluster, which encodes transcription factors that control stem cell self-renewal and promote aberrant self-renewal in AML cells14. HOXA genes are highly expressed in nearly two-thirds of all adult AML patients15–17, which means that therapeutic strategies to disrupt HOX regulatory pathways could potentially have important therapeutic benefits14,18,19. While progress has been made in understanding—and targeting—HOXA gene regulation in some rare AML types18,20, effective therapeutic strategies for most patients have not been identified. We will use genomic methods and functional analysis to define the specific 3D genome interactions, regulatory DNA elements, and epigenetic pathways that are responsible for HOXA gene activation in AMLs with common recurrent mutations. These findings may therefore suggest therapeutic targets that could be immediately useful for disrupting aberrant self-renewal in AML patients.
