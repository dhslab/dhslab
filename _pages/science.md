## Science

#### The Spencer lab studies the organization and function of the
     human genome and how altered genome function contributes to acute
     myeloid leukemia and other cancers. ####

epigenetics with a focus on AML.** We are specifically focused on acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), a devastating cancer that affects children and adults. Despite major
advances in the molecular understanding of this disease, current
therapies have changed little over the past 30
years. We aim to understand how mutations and epigenetic changes alter the structure
and function of the genome in ways that contribute to AML development, progression,
and relapse.

#### Current Research projects ####

1. **HOX gene regulation in AML.** HOX genes regulate normal
self-renewal in hematopoietic cells and are highly expressed in AML cells, suggesting they drive malignant
self-renewal in AML. ![HOXA interactions](/images/hoxainteractions.png){:width="150px"
style="float:right"}
Transcriptomic profiling of nearly 200 primary AML samples
by our group showed that HOXA and/or HOXB genes are highly expressed
in more than half of all AML patients and are therefore among the most
common drivers of self-renewal in AML cells [(Spencer et al., Leukemia
2015)](https://www.nature.com/articles/leu20156). These and other studies have also demonstrated that HOX gene
expression occurs in canonical, reproducible patterns in primary AML
samples that are closely associated with specific mutations. While progress has been made in understanding—and
targeting—HOX gene regulation in some rare AML types, effective
therapeutic strategies for most patients have not been
identified. Research in other experimental systems has shown that
three-dimensional (3D) genome interactions are important for regulating the HOXA gene cluster. We
have investigated the 3D genome architecture of the HOXA cluster in
AML cells with mutations in NPM1 and whether CTCF binding sites are
critical for normal HOXA gene regulation. These studies demonstrated
that CTCF binding within the HOXA locus is not absolutely required for
gene expression, but certain long-range interactions are weakend, and
others strengthened, upon deletion of specific CTCF binding sites
[(Ghasemi et. al., Leukemia 2020)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41375-020-0856-3). We
subsequently showed that certain interactions that were maintained
when CTCF sites were deleted displayed AML-specific patterns of DNA methylation
and histone modifications and therefore may represent AML-specific
HOXA enhancers. We are now using CRISPRi in AML samples and massively
parallel reporter assays in cell lines and primary AML samples to
define the cis-acting regulatory sequences that are critical for HOXA
expression in AML. These findings could therefore suggest novel
transcription factors that could be immediately useful for disrupting aberrant self-renewal in AML patients.
