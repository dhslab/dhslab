## The Spencer lab uses cutting edge approaches to understand the function of the human genome in health and disease ##

![AML blasts](/images/aml.png){:width="150px" style="float:right"} **Our group specializes in cancer genetics, genomics, and
epigenetics.** We are specifically focused on acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), a devastating cancer that affects children and adults. Despite major
advances in the molecular understanding of this disease, current
therapies have changed little over the past 30 years. We aim to
understand how mutations and epigenetic changes alter the structure
and function of the genome in ways that contribute to AML development, progression,
and relapse.
