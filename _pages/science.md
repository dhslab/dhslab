## The Spencer lab studies the organization and function of the human genome and how altered genome function contributes to cancer. ##

**Our group specializes in cancer genetics, genomics, and
epigenetics.** We are specifically focused on acute myeloid leukemia
(AML), a devastating cancer that affects children and adults. Despite major
advances in the molecular understanding of this disease, current
therapies have changed little over the past 30
years. ![AML blasts](/images/aml.png){:width="150px"

understand how mutations and epigenetic changes alter the structure
and function of the genome in ways that contribute to AML development, progression,
and relapse.
